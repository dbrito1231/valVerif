# valVerif

valVerif is a Java class used for error checking and validation in TextField objects.  The class currently consists of three methods, but will be added with more features.  The methods
all grab input from JavaFX TextField objects that a GUI would use.  Each method grabs an input from a field and checks for formatting and invalid characters.
